Problem 1: Write a function has_cycle that returns whether a mutable
list has a cycle. You may want a recursive helper function. Don't
worry about space usage.

  match !lst with
  | Nil -> failwith "tried to extract value from an empty list!"
  | Cons (h, _) -> h

(*
If a cycle exists, this function returns a tuple containing a true boolean,
the length of the cycle (an integer), the length of the list prior to the
cycle, a reference to the element at which
the cycle starts, and a reference to the predecessor of that element in the 
cycle. If a cycle does not exist, this function returns a tuple
containing a false boolean, -1 "length", the length of the list,
and two references to a Nil mutable list.

A full explanation and proof of correctness of our approach can be found in
the file "cycle_algorithm.pdf" in our Git repo (the LaTeX source is also 
included). Essentially, our approach utilizes a "fast" ref that traverses 
the list by advancing two nodes at a time, and a "slow" ref that traverses 
the list one node at a time. These refs will become physically equal (i.e. 
"point" to the same space in memory) at some time after the start if and 
only if a cycle exists. From there, we calculate the cycle length and use 
the cycle length to deduce the the start of the cycle. We also return the
predecessor (within the cycle) to the start of the cycle, so that we can 
easily flatten the cycle.

Notably, this approach does not require any memory beyond the memory taken 
by the list argument passed in and runs in worst case O(n) time, which
satisfies the demands of Challenge Problem 4.

A note on style: we made the decision to include the signatures of helper
functions in cycle_len_start_helper in order to make them less confusing

Problem 2: Write a function flatten that flattens a list (removes its
cycles if it has any) destructively. Again, you may want a recursive
helper function and you shouldn't worry about space.

A special case is needed to deal with the case of a single node whose
successor is itself. In this case, the head of lst (which is not passed
in as a ref) cannot be directly changed, so we change it by setting its tail
reference to refer to Nil.

  let lst_ref = ref lst in
  let (has_cycle, cycle_len, pre_cycle_len, _, last_node) =

nodes in a mutable list that may have cycles.
